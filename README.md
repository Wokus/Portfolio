# Portfolio  
Compilation of the major projects developed for and during my different studies.

These studies were two:  
- Technologist in Computer Science at UTU Arrayanes (TecnÃ³logo en InformÃ¡tica en UTU Arrayanes).  
- Professional Technologist in Computer Science at CURE Maldonado (TecnÃ³logo Profesional en InformÃ¡tica en CURE de Maldonado).  

# UTU Arrayanes  
## Storeroom Management System (Sistema gestor del PaÃ±ol)  
As the name suggests, it is an inventory management system for the storeroom of Arrayanes.  
This application serves both to manage the inventory and to handle equipment loan requests.  
Developed in C#, this is a two-layer system.

# CURE  
## Espotify  

Application developed for the course "ProgramaciÃ³n de aplicaciones" (Application Programming) in the fourth semester.  
It is a web application that functions as a music player. Developed with **Java** on the Back-End and **HTML** together with **JavaScript** on the Front-End.  
This application was designed as a three-layer system, distributed across three different machines: the web interface, the logic, and the persistence layer.

## Creatura  
System developed for the courses "Rich Internet Applications (RIA)" and *PHP*.  
A fantasy creature management system that allows users to create and share their own creatures.  
Designed as a two-layer system: a web presentation layer and a logic layer with database access.  
The presentation was developed in **Angular**, while the logic was implemented in **PHP** as an API.

## Docker Project  
A small Docker project that uses Docker Compose to set up two containers.  
One contains a simple Java application that connects to a PostgreSQL database using JPA,  
and the other container runs Data Miner, exposed on a public port to allow access from outside the container.
